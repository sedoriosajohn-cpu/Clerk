**Clerk** is an AI-assisted task organization and scheduling system designed to convert unstructured user input into structured, actionable tasks. Instead of acting like a traditional chatbot, Clerk utilizes a multi-stage processing pipeline to transform text, emails, and voice notes into organized tasks and scheduling recommendations.

The goal of Clerk is simple: **reduce manual task entry and make scheduling effortless.**
